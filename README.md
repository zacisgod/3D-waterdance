# 3D-waterdance
I completed a graduate project in 3D water dance simulation, which received the third and fifth place awards in the College of Engineering and Electrical Engineering Department graduate project contest that took place in my last semester. The simulation is more efficient, cost-effective, and accurate than animation. A water dance designer typically needs to design it through animation, which is expensive, inaccurate, and inefficient. For example, a 20-minute animation requires approximately two months to complete, and it cannot calculate the external force effect. The way I improved on this is through four main techniques. I first changed the 3D to 2D, so it projected the simulation on the 2D window. Second, I designed it to calculate the external force effects, such as gravity, wind resistance, and wind direction. Third, I enabled it to change the angle of the launch directions, such as left, right, and swing. Finally, I scaled the size of the objects by using the distance between them and the windows, which is calculated by the geometric zoom size.
